                    <p>
                        Hello, and welcome to my personal webpage. My name is Jack Pietrok, and I am currently a computer
                        engineering student attending California Polytechnic State University. The purpose of this website is
                        to record some of my past experiences and projects involving computer engineering. Since high school, I've
                        been interested in computer technology and software development, and today I'm pursuing this passion in 
                        both my personal and professional life. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My school and work experiences range from general software and web development to more
                        complex research-based projects. As of October 2017, I've completed my first year of school
                        at Cal Poly, and have spent the past summer as a tech intern at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) , in the National Security Directorate. I currently plan on returning to work at PNNL for the summer of 2018.
                        Below I have/will detail some of the projects I've completed in school and in my personal time.
                        By clicking the tabs above or scrolling through each section, you can see these as I write them :)
